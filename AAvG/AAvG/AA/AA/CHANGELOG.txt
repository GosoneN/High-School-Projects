BUG LIST
(4/20/13) Transfers don't work occasionally. Spawns character in wrong place.

Izzy (3/12/13)
	Worked on RoomManager, still working on how to set tiles in the rooms with an arraylist
	Working on Room westerwoodRoom first, working on loading content to the arraylist
	Made a moveRoom method in RoomManager
	In Game1 I added the escape functionality to exit the game by pressing esc
	Classes RoomManager and Room are still under heavy construction
Izzy (3/25/13)
	Still working on Room, mainly to solve the tile drawing
	A few hours later...Room is pretty much done and optimized
	Added Solid class, which makes drawing much easier
	Starting to work on Collision Handling, but need to start working on adding player to Room code
	Once that's done, I can do collision much easier
Izzy (3/29/13)
	Moved Zane's stuff from Game1 into RoomManager. Needed to do this for collision and future ease.
Izzy (4/5/13)
	Working on Entrance and Exit for Rooms, will use WhiteTile as my temp image
	Moved a ton of stuff from RoomManager to Room for efficiency. Only have to create things in currentroom, not all
Izzy (4/7/13)
	Fixed the problems in Room that prevented the game from drawing. Made an additional String variable to fix loop error.
Izzy (4/9/13)
	Changed the grass tile (just the image used for it)
	Room transfer is up and running! Made adjustments to Game1's update method and RM's moveroom method for this.
	Spawnpoint in new room needs to be adjusted.
Izzy (4/15/13)
	Trying to fix the spawnpoint issue when you transfer rooms. Made Vectors to hold positions of transfer objects.
	Added direction variable so i can check Zane's direction. Zane still does not spawn in the correct place in the new room. 
	Also odd, move rooms 3 times, Zane spawns at position 0,0...
	Took a break from the broken spawnpoint and started working on the main menu room (the first room)
	Just started setting it up, but I can tell that many things need to be changed in the Room class to accomodate a different
	type of room. Next time, I'll continue on these two tasks: fix spawnpoint and set up main menu room
Izzy (4/18/13)
	Created 2 classes: Menu and EventHandler
	Moved all things related to RoomManager and BattleManager from Game1 class to new EventHandler class.
	Created States for the EventHandler class. Starting to implement states, starting with MainMenu
Izzy (4/19/13)
	Starting to put the game in order. Created myMenus object in EventHandler to handle Menus and drawing them.
	The Menu class now has a DrawMainMenu method and a normal DrawMenu method so it can take care of both menus.
	Created a DrawCurrentRoom method in RoomManager. (I should've done this earlier.)
	The Update and Draw method in EventHandler both use the same ifs to check the state so they update and draw the correct things.
	So far the states: MainMenu, Overworld, and Battle work just fine. Change value of currentState to try them.
	Next, I'll work on pressing the button in MainMenu. Also, the game seems to have sped up.
Izzy (4/20/13)
	MainMenu buttons work except for LoadGame, which can be done later. Exit and Start function.
	Menu State has been implemented. Pressing <M> will pull up the menu and can also close the menu.
	Organized Content. Created folders for FG Tiles and BG Tiles, change files paths in code to accomodate new folders.
	Implemented all 4 grass tiles. Next up, moving window view on overworld.
Izzy (4/23/13)
	Added necessary objects to the Game1 class for MapRender drawing. Also added needed methods to Room class.
	Removed methods now deemed obsolete. Room Class: PrepareObjects, DrawBackground. PlayerMovement: charMove
	Starting to work on collision again. Need to make screen movement stop when collision occurs with edge.
Izzy (5/9/13)
	Still struggling with collision. How to make Zane's bounding box move with him along with the moving map?
	Zane is drawn by drawZane, using a var called zanePosition. His actual bounding box is based of his var called myPosition
	Both zanePosition and myPosition start in center of screen. zanePosition stays in the middle, but myPosition should move according to
	the movement of the map so that it's vector position matches up with the tiles. Is myPosition moving as it should?
	-->Collision happened! I added on the mapOffset in Game1 to myZane's myPosition. His position vector gets absurdly high though.
	Need to fix it so the collision actually occurs in the correct place.	
Izzy (5/11/13) all day coding session
	Collision is fixed!!! Zane cannot go past the edge blocks. (thanks to Game1's Update method and RoomManager's CollisionHandler method)
	Added foregound. There are now two maps drawing simultaneously. theBGMap and theFGMap (in Room's DrawMap method, BG draws first, then FG)
	Enemy stuff taken out of RoomManager and moved to Room. 
	In Room class, if "9" is in the layout txt files, an enemy is there. Enemy is created at that position and added to an arraylist.
	Enemies can only move up and down (Enemy class). They have bounding boxes and if zane touches one, the eventHandler state goes to State.Battle
Izzy (5/12/13)
	Made a class called IntroScene. Also added an eventHandler state called intro.
	I'm creating the intro so it will run on its own, displaying text and background according to timers
	The game will change a boolean to true when the intro is over, causing event handler to move the state to overworld
Izzy (5/14 and 5/15)
	Intro scene has animation, takes its dialogue from a text file, and plays on its own.
	Added new menu image and all the dialogue sprites.

G-San (4/1/13)
	Fixed a bug that prevent file reading :D
G-San (4/2/13)
	Added a enemy sprite who animates, but will later on act as a pathway to the battle room (yet to come)
G-San (4/6/13)
	Fixed a bug that prevent file reading again :D
G-San (4/8/13)
	I work weekdays now!
	Took out a few lines of codes from collisionHandler() *previousPosition 
		-EFFICIENCY! :D
	Added myPreviousPosition variable to the sprite class
		- getPreviousPosition() method added
	Added an Update() method to Sprite.cs
		- Inside it, "myPreviousPosition = myPosition;"
	Completely re-coded the Enemy.cs class
		-Changed how movements worked
			-There is now a method to move each direction
				-moveLeft(), moveUp(), moveRight(), moveDown();
		-Added in a bit more complicated movements
			-moveOpposite(), turnLeft(), turnRight()
	The enemy can now collide with the walls and react
	Made my changelogs more detailed :D
G-San (4/13/13)
	Altered the way enemy is inputed in roomanager
		-All the enemies are now inserted into an arraylist
		-Enemies can now be removed (Kind of a template to removing objects)
G-San (4/14/13)
	Started creating the battle room
		-If you collide with enemy, then transfer to battle room(westerBattle)
	*Next, I'm going to start creating the look of the battleroom.
G-San (4/15/13)
	Fix the transfer point coordination bug
		-Added a method to Room.cs
			-getTransfer() - Gets the transfer points only
	Added two new methods to Room class
		-getTransfer()
		-getSolids()
	Created a new class for battling, BattleZane
		-Included movement
		-No animation
		-Starting on gravity
		-Changed movement to velocity based movement
	Added a few more things to RoomManager class
G-San(4/16/13)
	Gravity is finished
		-Collision with ground is in BattleManager
		-gravity() is in BattleSprites
		-Adjusted falling speeds
	Now with comments!
	Fixed jumping so you can't hold UP (BattleZane)
	Made jumping more bouncy (BattleZane)
G-San(4/17/13)
	Started implementing States with BattleZane
	Started on Skill class
		-Working on cooldown
		-Prints out "Skill is ready." on console to test for cooldown
G-San(4/18/13)
	Fixed a bug that madee BattleZane fall through tiles
	westerBattle room is now empty
		-Replaced with a line of floor tiles
		-To add in background later
	Worked further on Skills class
		-Added some methods like onCooldown() 
G-San(4/19/13)
	Furthered Skill class
		-Added Draw() and Update() methods
	Started using Skill class in BattleZane
		-Press Z to "use" stab
			-I still need to : Change the Stab sprite, Change the animation of Zane, Make the skill end when animation ends.
			-Also need to make more skills
G-San(4/20/13)
	Continued adding more to Skills and BattleZane to enable the use of skills
	He jumps higher
	Having an obscene amount of trouble with a non-looping animation
		-It runs, but the animation goes way too fast
